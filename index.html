              <h3>What is a Cryptocurrency</h3>
              <p> According to CoinTelegraph.com</p>
              <blockquote>
                <p>
                  Digital or virtual currency [is] designed to work as a medium of exchange. It uses cryptography to secure and verify transactions as well as to control the creation of new units of a particular cryptocurrency. Essentially, cryptocurrencies are limited entries in a database that no one can change unless specific conditions are fulfilled. </p>
              </blockquote>
              <h3>Why would I want a Digital Currency? </h3>
              <p>Unlike currencies that are centralized in a single geographical region, cryptocurrencies don’t have to rely on one particular nation’s economic stability because they are not based in a particular nation. As a result, people living in countries with developing economies can use cryptocurrencies to protect their money from losing value as a result of inflation or a weak economy. But that’s just one of the many use cases for cryptocurrency. Some others include:</p>
              <ul>
              	<li>Investing</li>
              	<li>Spend like cash</li>
              	<li>Send Funds Internationally</li>
              </ul>
              <img id='hero'src="images/crypto.jpg" alt="Bitcoin">

              <p>
                Most importantly, cryptocurrencies are important because they take away the middle man and protect individual privacy. When you think about the mainstream financial system, users must often either sacrifice speed or pay extra fees when conducting transactions, paying third parties such as banks, credit card companies and currency exchange brokers to send funds from one entity to another. Not only is this system pricey and inefficient, it also sacrifices user privacy as each party involved in the transaction is likely to need confidential information about the users. </p>
              <h3>How Do I Buy Cryptocurrencies? </h3>
              <p>Just like you can visit a currency exchange kiosk at a bank or airport, you can exchange your traditional money for any of a variety of cryptocurrencies through physical ATMs or online exchanges such as <a target=_blank href=’coinbase.com’>Coinbase.com</a>.</p>
              <h3>Is it Safe to Buy Cryptocurrencies Online? </h3>
              <p>Whenever you buy something online there is a risk, but by only using trusted exchanges you can minimize the risk of fraud. You can read more about that <a target=_blank href=’ https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-for-beginners/how-can-i-buy-bitcoins’>here</a>.</p>
              <h3>Which Cryptocurrency Should I Buy?</h3>

              <p>That’s a great question! Unfortunately, there’s no cut and dry answer. It depends on what use-case you have for the coin. If you look at cryptocurrency as an investment than you could consider choosing a coin still in its Initial Coin Offering (or ICO as it is commonly referred to in the industry), but those are very high risk. Their prices fluctuate wildly similar to a stock on the stock market. You could also consider choosing a more established coin such Bitcoin, Litecoin or Ethereum which are all still risky, but have been around for a while and are more established. Another option is to buy a package of coins through an exchange like Coinbase that will give you the ability to own five different coins without having to make the purchases individually.
              <br /><br />
              On the other hand, if you are more interested in using cryptocurrency as a means to protect the value of your money while allowing you the ability to easily send it anywhere in the world than a stable coin would be a better option. These coins do not fluctuate in price the same way that most other coins do. Instead, their price is tied to that of a traditional currency such as the US dollar so that one coin will always be worth one USD.
              In the end, the decision about which coin to buy can seem overwhelming due to the sheer number of option. In order to help simplify that process, many exchanges hand-pick some of the more trusted coins and only list those on their exchange. Coinbase.com is a great example of this. That being said, a good place to start is deciding what you want to do with your coins, from there you can look online to find the coin that is best for you!</p>
