              <h3>What is a Cryptocurrency</h3>
              <p> According to CoinTelegraph.com</p>
              <blockquote>
                <p>
                  Digital or virtual currency [is] designed to work as a medium of exchange. It uses cryptography to secure and verify transactions as well as to control the creation of new units of a particular cryptocurrency. Essentially, cryptocurrencies are limited entries in a database that no one can change unless specific conditions are fulfilled. </p>
              </blockquote>
              <h3>Why would I want a Digital Currency? </h3>
              <p>Unlike currencies that are centralized in a single geographical region, cryptocurrencies don’t have to rely on one particular nation’s economic stability because they are not based in a particular nation. As a result, people living in countries with developing economies can use cryptocurrencies to protect their money from losing value as a result of inflation or a weak economy. But that’s just one of the many use cases for cryptocurrency. Some others include:</p>
              <ul>
              	<li>Investing</li>
              	<li>Spend like cash</li>
              	<li>Send Funds Internationally</li>
              </ul>
              <img id='hero'src="images/crypto.jpg" alt="Bitcoin">

              <p>
                Most importantly, cryptocurrencies are important because they take away the middle man and protect individual privacy. When you think about the mainstream financial system, users must often either sacrifice speed or pay extra fees when conducting transactions, paying third parties such as banks, credit card companies and currency exchange brokers to send funds from one entity to another. Not only is this system pricey and inefficient, it also sacrifices user privacy as each party involved in the transaction is likely to need confidential information about the users. </p>
              <h3>How Do I Buy Cryptocurrencies? </h3>
              <p>Just like you can visit a currency exchange kiosk at a bank or airport, you can exchange your traditional money for any of a variety of cryptocurrencies through physical ATMs or online exchanges such as <a target=_blank href=’coinbase.com’>Coinbase.com</a>.</p>
              <h3>Is it Safe to Buy Cryptocurrencies Online? </h3>
              <p>Whenever you buy something online there is a risk, but by only using trusted exchanges you can minimize the risk of fraud. You can read more about that <a target=_blank href=’ https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-for-beginners/how-can-i-buy-bitcoins’>here</a>.</p>
